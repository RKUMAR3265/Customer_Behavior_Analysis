This project is a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow that demonstrates how to load and explore a dataset using Python, perform EDA, clean and transform data, and run SQL queries across PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server. After preparing the data, an interactive Power BI dashboard was built to visualize key insights such as customer behavior, revenue trends, category performance, and demographic patterns. The project concludes with a polished analytics report created using Gamma to present findings and recommendations in a business-friendly format. The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analytics skills, including data wrangling, statistical exploration, SQL querying, dashboard creation, and professional reporting—all integrated into a clear, structured solution that can support real-world decision-making.
